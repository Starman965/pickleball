            <p>We discovered pickleball a few years ago and were immediately hooked by its unique blend of strategy, skill, and social interaction. As both players and developers, we saw an opportunity to create something that would help players track their games and progress.</p>
            <p>Pickleball Tracker is the result of combining our passion for the sport with our software development expertise. It's designed to be the perfect companion for players who want to focus on their game while having a reliable way to track their matches.</p>
